# PLAN — 2026-02-06 (Daily execution plan)

Generated: 2026-02-06T12:45:00Z

Objective: Consolidate backlog management, make daily snapshots traceable, document restore/resume procedures, and run prioritized minisprints to make the draft release-ready.

Roles I will assume (pick one or more):
- `agent.operator` — run scripts, tests, and create issues.
- `docs.owner` — create and maintain daily snapshots and MASTER_BACKLOG.
- `planner` — split complex tasks into minisprints and estimate.
- `trainer` — create agent resume/training docs.

Planned minisprints (each 1–4 hours; smaller parts allowed)

1) Security: Purge tokens planning (3 parts)
   - Part A (1h): Inventory and confirm candidate files (`doc/sprints/analysis/secrets_inventory_05_02_part1.md`).
   - Part B (2h): Draft `filter-repo` rules and generate a non-destructive dry-run plan PR.
   - Part C (1h): Prepare `CHECKPOINT_1.md` and request explicit approval.
   - Total est: 4h — owner: `planner`

2) Alby Agent dry-run prototype
   - Part A (2h): Minimal scaffold to run `alby_agent` in dry-run mode with a sample PR flow.
   - Part B (2h): Collect timing metrics and update estimates.
   - Total est: 4h — owner: `agent.operator`

3) Backlog & Issues (batch)
   - Part A (0.5h): Enrich `MASTER_BACKLOG_2026-02-06.md` with owners + scrum points.
   - Part B (1h): Batch-create GH issues for `critical`/`high` items.
   - Total est: 1.5h — owner: `agent.operator` (requires GH CLI)

4) Docs & Restore procedure
   - Part A (1h): Finalize `.copilot/session_state.json` schema and scripts to persist it.
   - Part B (1h): Create `scripts/restore_session.ps1` (or python) and document restore steps in `doc/restore_procedure.md`.
   - Total est: 2h — owner: `docs.owner` + `trainer`

5) Training / Agent resume playbook
   - Create `doc/agent_resume_and_training.md` with: how to resume, how to rebuild todo list, split complex problems into minisprints, and sample audit traces.
   - Est: 2h — owner: `trainer`

Deliverables for today
- Completed daily snapshots (naming convention) saved under repository root (e.g., `06_02_todo_list.md`, `06_02_project_overview.md`).
- Enriched `MASTER_BACKLOG_2026-02-06.md` with progress table and versioning policy (done).
- `PLAN_2026-02-06.md` (this file).

Commands & quick checks

Run smoke tests (already done):
```powershell
& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q | Tee-Object -FilePath .tmp\smoke_results.txt
```

Persist session state (example):
```powershell
python agents/save_session_state.py --task-id T001 --steps-completed 1 --next "inventory" --last_sync "2026-02-06T12:45:00Z"
```

Next immediate action I will take (with confirmation)
- Add owners + scrum points to `MASTER_BACKLOG_2026-02-06.md` and produce JSON/CSV export.
- Or batch-create GH issues for `critical`/`high` tasks (requires `gh auth login` or available `GITHUB_TOKEN`).
