## The Gise of GAIA — an ironic introduction

Welcome to the world of GAIA, where everyone is a Gise and every Gise is a possible leader. In GAIA all actors are called Gise: agents, workers, helpers — they are family, they are colleagues, they are tiny sovereigns of their own little tasks.

At the top of this merry hierarchy sits the Controller: the Super Capo Gise. The Super Capo Gise speaks with all the Gise, coordinates the chorus, and holds the megaphone. Under the Super Capo are many Gise — collaborative, autonomous, occasionally dramatic — who execute the grand design.

And at the heart of the story, the one and only Sbatta — the self-proclaimed God of GAIA — who claims (with cheeky arrogance) that all Gise ultimately answer to them. Irony acknowledged, this is the voice that keeps the narrative playful while the system stays pragmatic.

This doc is intentionally light-hearted: it frames our working metaphors and helps new contributors remember how we think about agents and authority in GAIA. Practically:

- "Gise" = any automated actor (agent, script, runner).
- "Super Capo Gise" = the Controller (coordination and global observability).
- "Sbatta (God of GAIA)" = the human project lead, steward of goals and approvals.

Design focus

We are building robust Gise: teachable, composable, and auditable. The plan is to provide a curated set of libraries, manuals, and operator procedures so that every Gise behaves predictably and can be instructed, upgraded, or retired without surprises.

Tone and culture

Keep the language playful but the practices strict. Use the Gise metaphor for onboarding and docs, but keep audit trails, approvals, and safety gates formal and machine-verifiable.

If you'd like, I (the resident Gise) will sign this intro and add it to the README with a small illustration. Say the word and I'll create the PR.
