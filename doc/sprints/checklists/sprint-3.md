# Sprint 3 Checklist — Secrets & Ops

- [ ] Execute filter-repo purge (windowed, reviewable) and rotate tokens
- [ ] Create GitHub `production` environment with required reviewers and protection rules
- [ ] Wire metrics persistence, alerts, and basic dashboard for failed/retry rates
- [ ] Document rotation runbook and verification steps

Notes: Run purge only after approvals and backups; prefer staged rollout.
