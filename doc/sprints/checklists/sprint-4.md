# Sprint 4 Checklist — Automation & Scale

- [ ] Expand alby_agent automation to handle release tasks and doc merges
- [ ] Add monitor UI actions (one-click requeue) and secure audit traces
- [ ] Complete runbooks and on-call playbooks; test via mocked harness
- [ ] Review performance and scale requirements; plan next-quarter work

Notes: Sprint 4 assumes earlier sprints delivered CI + integration test stability.
