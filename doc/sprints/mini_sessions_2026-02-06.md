## Mini-sprint: Sessions & Delegated Updater — 2026-02-06

Goal
- Deliver a small, testable integration that materializes `gaia.db` backlog into a human-facing GitHub Projects view and prototype the delegated updater (opt-in, gated).

Top picks (6 items)
- `T013` — Enable Sessions mapping + sync (extend prototype mapping, add unit tests)
- `T014` — Create GH issues for critical items (execute existing draft `T006` as a batch)
- `T015` — Draft approval/gating for delegated updater (CHECKPOINT workflow + audit requirements)
- `M301` — Implement delegated updater (opt-in, record audits; do not enable without approval)
- `M302` — Docs: session workflow checklist (operational runbook)
- `M303` — Add CI smoke: dry-run create/update GitHub issues (dry-run guarded)

Plan (2 days)
- Day 1: finalise mapping, add unit tests for `agents/github_sessions_sync.py`, execute dry-run and produce GH issue drafts.
- Day 2: draft approval/gating docs, implement audit writes on sync runs, and (optionally) run updater against test repo with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Acceptance criteria
- `agents/github_sessions_sync.py` runs in dry-run and produces consistent payloads from `gaia.db`.
- Approval/gating doc exists and references `CHECKPOINT_1.md` style approval flow.
- Audit writes are present in `gaia.db` for each sync attempt.

Notes
- This minisprint intentionally avoids rotating tokens or enabling remote writes to production until `CHECKPOINT` approval is obtained.

Files created/updated
- `agents/github_sessions_sync.py` (prototype dry-run) — created
- `doc/AGENT_SESSION_WORKFLOW.md` — created
- `doc/todo-archive.ndjson` — will be appended with minisprint task entries
