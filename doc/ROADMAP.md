# ROADMAP — Short-term roadmap (next 3 sprints)

Purpose
- High-level roadmap for the rotation pilot, docs consolidation, and CI stabilization work.

Now → Sprint 1 (2 weeks)
- Stabilize pre-prod E2E and make mock service reliable (blocking CI). Updated: 2026-02-05 00:00
- Complete docs consolidation and master index. Updated: 2026-02-05 00:00
- Create `dev` and `pre-prod` GitHub Environments and migrate secrets. Updated: 2026-02-05 00:00

Sprint 2
- Execute opt-in history-rewrite after owners approve and secrets rotated.
- Finalize auto-merge policy and branch protection.

Sprint 3
- Expand rotation pilot to include a token rotation runner and canary rollout.
- Add monitoring and alerting for secret-rotation failures.

Notes
- All dates/times must use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` (UTC preferred). Preserve older `Created:` timestamps when updating docs.
