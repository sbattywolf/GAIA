# SCRUM Plan (draft) - 2026-02-03T000000Z

Sprint goals (2-week):
- Stabilize monitor and UI; ensure start/stop flows work reliably on Windows.
- Provide `gaia` CLI with basic installer and agent manager.
- Add CI integration for nightly integration run.

Backlog (prioritized):
1. CLI packaging and entry point (done)
2. Installer agent (dry-run + apply) (done)
3. Agent start/stop idempotency and single-instance enforcement
4. Resource monitoring + psutil install flow
5. Remote approval flow via Telegram (approval listener)
5. Playbook and operator docs (this file)
6. Automated tests + nightly runner
7. Optional: Telegram/WhatsApp webhook stubs for alerts (no credentials stored)

Acceptance criteria:
- `python -m gaia.cli install` runs dry-run without errors.
- `python -m gaia.cli agents list` prints configured agents.
- Traces for start/stop are persisted in `gaia.db`.
