## What is GPS?

GPS (Graduatorie Provinciali per Supplenze) is the Italian provincial ranking system for assigning substitute teaching positions in public schools. It's updated every two years and determines the order in which teachers are called for temporary positions.

---

## Key Changes in GPS 2026

### 1. New Assignment Algorithm with Re-Entry System

**Problem Solved**: Previously, candidates who didn't express all available locations were permanently excluded from subsequent assignment rounds, even with high scores.

**New Solution**: 
- Automatic reconsideration in later phases
- Respects expressed preferences
- More meritocratic and transparent

### 2. Teaching Continuity Priority

For students with disabilities, the system now formalizes:
- Priority confirmation of support teachers upon family request
- Teacher consent required
- Absolute priority over other assignments

### 3. Stricter Certification Requirements

**IT Certifications**:
- Only Accredia-accredited entities valid
- Previously submitted certifications grandfathered
- Impact: many may lose points

**Language Certifications**:
- CLIL valid only from recognized universities
- Uniform evaluation criteria
- International standards prioritized

**PhD Recognition**:
- Increased weight in scoring
- Better recognition of advanced research

### 4. Updated Access Requirements

**Major Change**: 24 CFU no longer valid
**New Requirement**: 60 CFU qualification pathways for some teaching categories

**Goal**: Favor longer, more structured training paths

### 5. Anticipated Timeline

⏰ **Critical Change**: Application window is **earlier** than previous editions

- **Expected Period**: Late January - Mid February 2026
- **Duration**: Approximately 20 days
- **Method**: Online portal only
- **No Automatic Renewal**: Must submit application even to maintain current position

### 6. Workload Aggregation

Schools must aggregate residual hours to offer positions with maximum possible hours, reducing split contracts.

### 7. No Automatic Renewal

❌ **Critical**: Failure to submit application = exclusion for entire 2026-2028 biennium, even if previously enrolled

---

## Timeline & Critical Dates

### Application Phase
- **When**: Late January - Mid February 2026
- **Duration**: ~20 days
- **How**: Online portal (SPID/CIE required)

### What Can Be Declared
✅ All qualifications obtained **before deadline**  
✅ Current service (provisional, to be confirmed)  
❌ Qualifications obtained **after deadline**

---

## Impact Analysis

### Opportunities
✅ More meritocratic system  
✅ Greater transparency  
✅ Recognition of quality training  
✅ Better teaching continuity  
✅ Reduced favoritism

### Challenges
⚠️ Tight timeline (20 days)  
⚠️ Many certifications may lose validity  
⚠️ New 60 CFU paths are costly  
⚠️ Potential technical issues with portal

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before December 2025)
1. Verify IT certification validity (Accredia accreditation)
2. Check language certification recognition
3. Gather all qualification documentation
4. Review current scores
5. Plan missing qualifications

### Documentation Phase (January 2026)
1. Prepare digital copies of all qualifications
2. Prepare substitute declarations
3. Digitize paper certificates
4. Verify administrative references

### Submission Phase (February 2026)
1. Monitor portal for opening
2. Submit early (avoid last day)
3. Save receipt and protocol
4. Verify submission in personal area
5. Keep backup copy

## Strategic Considerations

### Who Benefits Most
- Teachers with complete, recognized qualifications
- Those with high continuous service records
- Support teachers with family requests
- Those who prepare documentation early

### Who Needs Extra Attention
- Teachers with non-Accredia IT certifications
- Those with tight timelines for completing qualifications
- Teachers considering province changes
- First-time GPS applicants

### Risk Factors
- Missing the 20-day window = 2-year exclusion
- Invalid certifications = point loss
- Portal technical issues
- Incomplete documentation
