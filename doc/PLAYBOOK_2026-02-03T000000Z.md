# GAIA Playbook (draft) - 2026-02-03T000000Z

Purpose
- Provide operator playbook for common tasks: environment setup, agent lifecycle, recovery, and upgrades.

Quick run
- Dry-run installer:

```powershell
python -m gaia.cli install
```

- Apply installer:

```powershell
python -m gaia.cli install --apply
```

Agent lifecycle
- List agents: `python -m gaia.cli agents list`
- Start agent: `python -m gaia.cli agents start --agent-id <id>`
- Stop agent: `python -m gaia.cli agents stop --agent-id <id>`

Recovery
- If monitor fails, restart Flask monitor, then run `python -m gaia.cli agents status` to verify PIDs.

Audit
- Actions are appended to `events.ndjson` and traces stored in `gaia.db` `traces` table.

Approval Play
- To approve automated apply steps remotely, use Telegram. Run `scripts/approval_listener.py` to wait for the single-word approval `APPROVE` from your chat id. When approval is received GAIA records it and can proceed with apply.

Notes
- System package installs are not executed by default; they require `--allow-system` and explicit approval.
