## Introduction

The GPS (Graduatorie Provinciali per Supplenze - Provincial Rankings for Substitute Teachers) update for the 2026-2028 biennium introduces substantial changes to the teacher ranking and substitute assignment system. These modifications aim to make the system more meritocratic, transparent, and efficient, addressing critical issues that emerged in previous editions.

This document analyzes the main updates in detail, provides operational guidelines, and illustrates the expected impact on teachers.

## Main Updates

### Summary of Key Changes

The ministerial ordinance for the GPS 2026 update introduces eight macro-areas of change:

1. **New re-entry algorithm** for substitute assignment
2. **Guaranteed teaching continuity** for support roles
3. **Stricter criteria** for qualification assessment
4. **Aggregation of split hours** for more complete positions
5. **Earlier timeline** for application submission
6. **No automatic renewal** of rankings
7. **New qualification pathways** with updated requirements
8. **Strict rules** for transfers between rankings

---

## Re-Entry Mechanism

### The Previous Problem

In previous GPS editions, candidates who didn't express all available locations were permanently excluded from subsequent assignment rounds, even if they had high scores. This mechanism unfairly penalized many deserving teachers.

### The New Solution

The new algorithm introduces a **meritocratic re-entry system** with the following features:

- **Automatic reconsideration**: unassigned candidates are reconsidered in subsequent phases
- **Respect for preferences**: the system attempts to match emerging availabilities with expressed preferences
- **Transparency**: greater clarity on assignment criteria
- **Meritocracy**: score once again has a determining weight

### Expected Benefits

✅ Reduction of unjust exclusions  
✅ Better utilization of available competencies  
✅ Greater fairness in assignments  
✅ Transparency in selection processes

---

## Qualifications and Certifications Assessment

### IT Certifications

**New Stringent Criteria:**

- ⚠️ **Limited validity**: only certifications issued by **Accredia**-accredited entities
- ✅ **Grandfathering**: previously submitted certifications maintain validity
- 📋 **Documentation**: verification of certifying entity accreditation required

**Impact**: score reduction for non-compliant certifications; need to verify validity of one's IT qualifications.

### Language Certifications

**Assessment Uniformity:**

- 🎓 **CLIL**: evaluated only if issued by recognized universities
- 📊 **Homogeneous criteria**: elimination of score disparities between different certification types
- ✅ **Official recognition**: greater weight to certifications with international standards

### PhD (Doctorate)

**Greater Recognition:**

- ⭐ **Increased weight**: doctorate acquires greater value in overall score
- 🎯 **Advanced training valorization**: recognition of advanced research path

### ITP and Support

**Equal Treatment:**

- ⚖️ **Elimination of disparities**: standardization of scores between ITP teachers and graduates for support roles
- ✅ **Equity**: same recognition for equivalent competencies

### Summary of Modifications

| Qualification | Change | Impact |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| IT certifications | Only Accredia entities | High |
| Language certifications | Assessment uniformity | Medium |
| PhD | Greater weight | Medium-High |
| ITP vs Graduates | Score equality | Medium |
| 24 CFU | No longer valid | High |
