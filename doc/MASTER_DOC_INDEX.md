# MASTER_DOC_INDEX — GAIA documentation index

This file is a curated index of important documentation in the `doc/` folder. Use this as the first stop when looking for runbooks, plans, and policies.

- HISTORY_REWRITE_PLAN.md — Safe history-rewrite plan and checklist.
- ROTATION_PILOT_README.md — Token rotation pilot usage notes and smoke-check steps.
- ENVIRONMENTS.md — Dev vs pre-prod environment guidance.
- DOCS_STRATEGY.md — Documentation policy, timestamp format, and migration guidance.
- SECRETS.md (if present) — Secrets handling and detect-secrets usage.
- CHANGELOG.md — User-visible change history (create if missing).

If you add or update docs, please update this index (or run the index generator script) and include `Created:` / `Updated:` headers in the document.
