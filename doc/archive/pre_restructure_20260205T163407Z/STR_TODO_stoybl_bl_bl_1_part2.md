**STR_TODO_stoybl_bl_bl_1_part2**

Purpose
- Implement `t6`: prepare and execute part2 of the story focusing on CLI/UI integration and runbook finalization.

Acceptance criteria
- A `doc/` draft for part2 exists and is linked from the main STR.
- Minimal working CLI examples and monitor UI flows are added to `doc/HANDOFF.md` and the monitor UI prototype.

Plan
1. Create `doc/STR_TODO_stoybl_bl_bl_1_part2.md` (this file).
2. Implement CLI ergonomics and JSON output for `claim_cli.py` (see cli-ui substory).
3. Add UI endpoints and tests for approve/deny/requeue.
4. Draft runbook snippets and include them under `doc/HANDOFF.md`.
