# TODO — F-security-token (Security & token rotation)

Status: planned

Tasks
- [ ] t11 — Document recommended file permissions and storage for `.tmp/telegram.env`
- [ ] t12 — Create `.env.template` and usage guidance
- [ ] t13 — Add `scripts/rotate_admin_token.py` scaffold and CLI

Notes
- These are priority items for secure operations. I will implement the docs and scaffolds as early work in the schedule.
