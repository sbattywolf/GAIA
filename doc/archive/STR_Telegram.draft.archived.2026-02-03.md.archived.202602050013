STR_Telegram — Draft Expansion (archived)

Purpose
- Draft: expand the operator playbook with examples, decision criteria, and escalation paths.

Planned additions
- Example workflows: manual requeue, automatic requeue policy decisions, and safe dry-run steps.
- Add CLI examples with full flags and example outputs.
- Add runbook steps to rotate admin token and revoke access.
- Add monitoring thresholds and alert playbooks (when to Telegram-notify vs escalate).

Open questions
- Default claim TTL for human approvals (suggest 300s — discuss).
- Requeue policy: maximum auto-retries before manual review.

Acceptance criteria
- Clear examples for approve/deny via UI and CLI.
- Runbook steps tested locally (monitor server + sample failed queue).
