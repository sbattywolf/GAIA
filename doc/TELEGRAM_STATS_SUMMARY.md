# Telegram Notifications — Stats Summary

Source: `telegram_updates.json` (repo root)

Summary (as of this run)
- Total recorded updates: 0
- Note: `telegram_updates.json` currently contains an empty `result` array.

Recommendation
- Review the Telegram sender/summary script: ensure it writes updates to `telegram_updates.json` or to `events.ndjson` for auditability.
- Keep current notification frequency unchanged until we have historical data; then evaluate weekly/monthly aggregated frequency adjustments.
