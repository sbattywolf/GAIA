Planned execution: work through `F-helper-gise` (part1→part2), then prioritize high/critical stories: security, command-safety, integration-tests, retryer. I will run validator/tests and small helpers, archive snapshots, update scoring and append progress notes every 10 minutes. No prompts unless a hard failure requires attention.
