# Sprint Plan — 2026-02-07

Date: 2026-02-07

## Top priorities

- Critical: T001 — Purge leaked tokens (prepare filter-repo dry-run + CHECKPOINT_1.md)
- High: T002, T008 — finalize detect-secrets and continue `alby_agent` dry-run
- Medium: T016, T006 — assign owners/scrum points and create GH issue drafts

## Today's goals

1. Draft and publish `CHECKPOINT_1.md` describing purge plan, rollback, and approval steps.
2. Validate canonical `doc/todo-archive.ndjson` (already replaced) and run quick sanity checks.
3. Run pytest smoke locally and capture summary; record results in sprint artifacts.
4. Open branch `feat/update-sprint-2026-02-06`, commit current changes, and prepare PR draft (dry-run only until CHECKPOINT approval).
5. Prepare `.tmp/gh_issue_drafts/` for top critical items (no remote calls).

## Quick check-ins

- Sync with rotation/inventory owners about environment rotation plan (T014/T201 scope).
- Note: destructive actions (filter-repo) must wait for explicit approval recorded in `CHECKPOINT_1.md`.

## Artifacts created/used

- `doc/todo-archive.ndjson` (canonicalized)
- `doc/todo-archive.dryrun.diff` (review)
- `sprints/2026-02-07_day_plan.md` (this file)
