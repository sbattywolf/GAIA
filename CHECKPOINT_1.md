CHECKPOINT 1 — Execute automation runner actions

Plan:

1. Proceed to execute approved automation tasks from `tasks.json`.
2. Perform side-effecting actions (create issue, post to external APIs) only after this checkpoint is approved.
3. After approval, runner will update `.copilot/session_state.json` and perform micro-commit steps.

Approval:

Add the single word APPROVATO (uppercase) anywhere in this file to permit execution.

Current status: PENDING
